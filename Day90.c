/*Problem Statement
Given n boards of different lengths and k painters, each painter paints contiguous boards. Painting a unit length of board takes one unit of time.

Determine the minimum time required to paint all boards.

Input Format
n k
n space-separated integers representing board lengths

Output Format
Print the minimum time required to paint all boards.

Sample Input
4 2
10 20 30 40

Sample Output
60

Explanation
One painter paints boards of length 10, 20, and 30 (total 60),
while the other paints board of length 40.*/
